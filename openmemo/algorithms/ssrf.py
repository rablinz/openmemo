    This algorithm is a result of Dariusz Laska's (dariuszlaska(at)gmail.com) 
    work on the spaced repetition area. He is the author of algorithm concepts 
    and foundations. We would like to thank him for the donation and support 
    he provided us with during the implementation and testing phases.
    
    Objectives
    ==========
    1. maximize local accuracy -> maximize the probability of one-period recall 
    for a particular item.
    2. maximize global accuracy -> maximize the probability of recall for all the items.

    local specificity: expanding rehearsal (spaced repetitions) and overlearning avoidance,
    global specificity: cognitive load avoidance (by minimizing average workloads 
    and average difficulty of scheduled study material)

    local accuracy: there is a set of acceptable inter-repetition intervals for an item .
    global accuracy: there is a good interval in a set of the acceptable intervals 
    found by minimizing an average workload and an average difficulty.

    Parameters
    ==========
    * Number of reviews `n` - number of days when an item was presented for a review 
    (if you see an item few times during one session, n increases just by one)
    * Average Grade `AG(n-1)` - estimated mean value of grades for (n-1)-th review 
    (thus current grade is not included)
    * current Grade `G(n)` - first grade given during n-th (current) review, 
    next grades during n-th session are biased (you have already seen an answer), 
    so they are simply ignored
    * Priority of material `P` - can be set by an user locally (for a particular item) 
    or globally (for specific categories or even for a whole database)

    Parameters and inter-repetition intervals
    -----------------------------------------
    ================================  ===========================
    Parameters                        Intervals (ceteris paribus)
    ================================  ===========================
    higher Number of reviews `n`      longer
    higher Average Grade `AG(n-1)`    longer
    higher current Grade `G(n)`       longer
    higher Priority of material P`P`  shorter

    Grades and their meanings
    =========================
    =====  ====================  ===========
    Grade  An answer is          Domain
    =====  ====================  ===========
    5      instantly recalled    recall
    4      slowly recalled       recall    
    3      partially recalled    recall
    2      instantly recognized  recognition
    1      slowly recognized     recognition
    0      not recognized        recognition

    Remark:
    Average Grade AG(n-1) = 2.5 means that the quality of an answer is somewhere 
    between 'instantly recognized' and 'partially recalled'.
    
    If the probability of recognition is very high, say ~100%, 
    then the probability of recall equals ~50%, thus even if the recognition 
    is certain, the recall is still highly uncertain.

    Priorities of a studied material
    ================================
    ========  ======  =============  ===================      
    Priority  Values  Objective      Suggested for words
    ========  ======  =============  ===================
    high      4.0    total accuracy  most common (<= 2,000)
    mid       3.0    ...             frequent (<= 10,000)
    low       2.0    total recall    rare (> 10,000)

    Formulas used in the algorithms
    ===============================
    SSRF
    ----
    Calculates a maximum acceptable value of inter-repetition interval 
    for a given number of reviews, average and current grades 
    and for a specific priority of studied material. 
    To avoid an overlearning effect, it assumes 1 day as the minimum interval.
    
    ::   
        SSRF = overlearning correction interval + base interval * scale factor        
        SSRF(n, AG(n-1), G(n), P) = 1 + n ^ (AG(n-1) / 2) * exp(G(n) - P)
        
    where
    * n - number of reviews
    * AG(n-1) - previous average grade
    * G(n) - current grade
    * P - priority of material

    difficulty
    ----------
    Calculates a difficulty of a LU through comparing its last interval
    with the interval of an ideal LU.
        
    The ideal LU is a LU with the average grade (AG) = 5.0 and the current grade = 5 
    
    :: 
        D(P, Iideal, Ilast) = ln((Iideal + 1.0) / (Ilast + 1.0))
    
    where
    * Iideal = SSRF(n, 5.0, 5, P)
    * Ilast - last interval
    * P - priority of material

    load coefficient
    ----------------
    Mean squared error of minimun workload to daily workload ratio and 
    minimum average difficulty to daily average difficulty ratio.  
    
    ::
        LC(W, Wmin, AD, ADmin) = ((Wmin / W - 1) ^ 2 + (ADmin / AD - 1) ^ 2) / 2
        if W = Wmin then Wmin / W = 1
        if AD = ADmin then ADmin / AD = 1
    
    where
    * W - workload for a given date
    * Wmin - minimum workload in a given period
    * AD - average difficulty for a given date
    * ADmin - minimum average difficulty in a given period

    How it works, or finding a good inter-repetition interval
    =========================================================
    #. If the LU has FINAL_DRILL status, look at the current grade. 
    If the grade is between 0 and 2, return (without doing anything).
    If the grade is between 3 and 5, change status to RECOGNITION and return. 
    
    #. Calculate minimum and maximum acceptable repetion intervals:
    Imin = SSRF[n, AG(n-1), G(n) - 1, P]
    Imax = SSRF[n, AG(n-1), G(n), P]

    #. Collect workloads for dates between min. and max. acceptable repetition 
    interval (both inclusive).
    
    #. If there is at least one date with zero workload, choose the latest date
    with the zero workload as the good interval.
    
    #. Otherwise collect average difficulties for dates between min. and max. 
    acceptable repetition interval (both inclusive).

    #. Calculate load coefficients for each date between the min. and max.
    acceptable repetition interval (both inclusive).
    
    #. Calculate daily workloads and average difficulties in case the repetition 
    of current LU was scheduled on each date from min. - max. acceptable interval period.
    
    ::
        Wnew = W + 1 (for each date)
        Dnew = D(P, Iideal, I), where I = Imin, Imin + 1, ... Imax - 1, Imax
        ADnew = (W * AD + Dnew) / Wnew (for each date) 

    #. Calculate load coefficients for each date in case of LU repeated on this date
    
    #. An interval with the maximum load coefficient reduction = good interval (day)
    
    #. Depending on the grade, set the LU status: FINAL_DRILL for grades between 0 and 2, 
    RECOGNITION for status between 3 and 5.
